# Happy Thoughts
This weeks project was to create a twitter inspired page about happy thoughts. The page have a form where anyone can post happy thoughts and it displays the 20 latest messages and have the possibility to like the messages with help of a like-button in the shape of a heart.

## The problem
I started by creating a sketch and divided the project into smaller parts. I created different components, one for the form where a new thought can be sent, one for showing the latest posts and one for storing the URL for the API:s. 

My main problem for this week was to understand the useEffect and also how different part is connected with eachother. To solve my problem during the week I used StackOverflow, google and also had some code alongs with my team. 

If I had more time I would try to understand the different parts of React (like useEffect) better.
